                    <p>SparkHacks is a collegiate hackathon intended to give individuals an opportunity to learn and join their knowledge to create a solution towards a common goal. We are a group of student organizations at UIC working together to build an inclusive environment for students to work on their projects. We are mainly focused on Computer Science which is where our passion lies as well as building a community at UIC! We are made up of ACM, LUG, WiCS, and SWE. This website was made by a Special Interest Group of ACM which develops websites, and SIG SysAdmin which provides the hosting platform for this site! WiCS and SWE encourage women and other underrepresented groups to pursue careers in tech and to support these groups throughout their university careers. LUG is a student organization that focuses on bringing more knowledge of computing with the Linux operating system and provides support for the backbone of tech stacks.</p>
