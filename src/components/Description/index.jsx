                        <p>Sparkhacks is a UIC wide, student organization led, and diverse collegiate hackathon. This event will consist of a theme that will be announced the evening of Friday the 8th which then students work on a project throughout the rest of the day until the afternoon of Saturday the 9th where students will submit their projects where they will be showcased. There will be 3 categories of prizes that consist of No-code/beginner, intermediate, and advanced projects. There will be workshops to allow students to learn useful skills that they can apply to their project. There will also be companies recruiting at the event, so make sure to have your resume available! Each project will be worked on by a team of 4 people. There will be one overarching theme which will have more specific projects in the no-code/beginner and intermediate levels to give more time to the hackers! There will also be food available to the students which will be posted on the calendar!</p>
