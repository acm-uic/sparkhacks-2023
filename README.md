# UIC SparkHacks 2023 Website

Welcome to the UIC SparkHacks 2023 student built website! The following will show you how to get started making your first contribution!

## Setting up your environment

> This guide assumes you have your Github [setup with an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), and that you have been added to the project

You will need to install the following programs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Use the LTS release)

Once you have installed the above, open your terminal and execute the following commands
- `git clone git@github.com:acm-uic/flourish-2023.git` (You may want to clone this to your Downloads or other folder)
- `cd flourish-2023`
- `npm install`

Once you have done these steps, you are good to go!

## Running the application

Running the website locally is as simple as `npm start`!

## Making a contribution

Follow the guide in the [wiki](https://github.com/acm-uic/flourish-2023/wiki/Guide-to-Contribution)

### Helper scripts

I have included some helper scripts for those of you who are new to Git

#### `bin/prep.sh`

This script prepares the Git environment for you to start your development from a fresh and up to date point.

`Usage: bin/prep.sh <name-of-your-branch>`

Make sure your branch name is correctly formatted, no spaces, no uppercase, dashes seperate words, and descriptive

#### `bin/commit.sh`

This script pushes your latest changes to your branch and prepares it for a pull request.

`Usage: bin/commit.sh`

If it is your first push it will give you a link to create a pull request. Click that link and create the pull request.

This script will likely open your editor asking for input. Put the title of the PR in the first line, and the description in the second line. (Hint: If your default is VIM or VI, use `:wq` to exit)
